## About

This is a mod for [Heroes of Newerth](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com) to alert players before a rune spawns or before it is time to stack creeps.
You can customize the sound effect, color, and timer-offset of the alerts in the HoN `Mods` settings.

Based on a [Mod by Akai_baraue](http://honmods.com/index.php?r=mod/view/22-rune-and-stack-timer).

## Installing
0. You will need the [HoN Mod Manager](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?25883-HoN-Modification-Manager-1-3-6) to use this mod. So first, install that.

1. Once that is installed, you can download the latest release of the `Rune and Stack Timer` mod from [here](https://github.com/mrhappyasthma/HoN-RuneAndStackTimer/releases/download/Latest/HoN-RuneAndStackTimer.honmod).

2. Place the downloaded `HoN-RuneAndStackTimer.honmod` file into your Heroes of Newerth directory under `game/mod` folders. For example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroes of Newerth\game\mods`.

3. Open up `HoN Mod Manager` and enable `Rune and Stack Timer` mod: <br/><br/>

*Note: You will need to re-apply mods every time HoN is updated.* <br/><br/>
*This is done manually by opening HoN Mod Manager. It will detect the version change and give you a pop-up asking if you'd like to re-apply. Click yes, and you're good to go! If not, you're client WILL be very buggy.*

## Updating
Updating is also done through the `HoN Mod Manager`. Simply click on `File -> Download Mod Updates`: <br/><br/>
